BCG (Bacillus Calmette-Guerin) a live attenuated strain of Mycobacterium bovis, is currently the only agent approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for primary therapy of carcinoma in situ of the bladder. BCG supplanted cystectomy as the treatment of choice for CIS in the mid-1980s. BCG therapy also reduces the risk of recurrence, and ongoing maintenance therapy with BCG reduces the risk of progression in patients with high-grade nonâ€“muscle invasive bladder cancer.
